# ClimatePredictionChallengesProject3
This research project focuses on studying feature importance in the ML model that reconstructs surface ocean pCO2. Our main concern was to analyze and validate the physical nature of the model, and identify whether additional data was required to improve it. We conduct a SHAP value analysis to validate that trends in the features make physical sense. We also investigate connections between model inaccuracies and their respective features.
